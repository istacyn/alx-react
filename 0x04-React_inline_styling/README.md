# React inline styling

This project focuses on the following concepts:
* Using inline styling instead of CSS file
* Using a CSS-in-JS tool like Aphrodite
* Using conditions within JS to apply different styles
* Using responsive design to make the application show a different UI according to the screen size
* Creating small animations within the app
